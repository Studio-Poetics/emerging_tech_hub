      <h1>Learning to Code with P5.js</h1>
      <p>
        The computer is a medium for creative expression. Just as painters use brushes and canvas,
        sculptors use clay and tools, you can use code to create, explore, and express ideas.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is an introduction to programming through P5.js, designed specifically for designers
        and artists who are encountering code for the first time. You will learn the fundamentals
        of computational thinking by making visual, interactive work.
      </p>

      <h2>Course Structure</h2>
      <p>
        This course contains 9 comprehensive lessons that progress from basic concepts to creative systems.
        Each lesson includes interactive code examples that you can modify in real-time to see
        immediate results.
      </p>

      <div class="lesson-grid">

        <a href="lessons/01-canvas.html" class="lesson-card" id="lesson-canvas">
          <div class="lesson-number">Lesson 1</div>
          <h3>The Canvas</h3>
          <p>
            Understanding digital space. The canvas is your drawing surface, and every point has
            a precise location in the coordinate system.
          </p>
        </a>

        <a href="lessons/02-shapes.html" class="lesson-card" id="lesson-shapes">
          <div class="lesson-number">Lesson 2</div>
          <h3>Shapes</h3>
          <p>
            Building blocks of visual composition. Circles, rectangles, lines, and triangles are
            your visual vocabulary.
          </p>
        </a>

        <a href="lessons/03-numbers.html" class="lesson-card" id="lesson-numbers">
          <div class="lesson-number">Lesson 3</div>
          <h3>Drawing with Numbers</h3>
          <p>
            Variables and mathematical thinking. Learn to create relationships between values
            and think computationally about space and form.
          </p>
        </a>

        <a href="lessons/04-loops.html" class="lesson-card" id="lesson-loops">
          <div class="lesson-number">Lesson 4</div>
          <h3>Loops</h3>
          <p>
            Repetition and pattern. Use loops to create grids, sequences, and systematic
            compositions from simple rules.
          </p>
        </a>

        <a href="lessons/05-conditionals.html" class="lesson-card" id="lesson-conditionals">
          <div class="lesson-number">Lesson 5</div>
          <h3>Conditional Statements</h3>
          <p>
            Making decisions in code. Create work that adapts and responds based on conditions
            and logic.
          </p>
        </a>

        <a href="lessons/06-motion.html" class="lesson-card" id="lesson-motion">
          <div class="lesson-number">Lesson 6</div>
          <h3>Motion</h3>
          <p>
            Time and change. Computation brings movement to your work through the animation loop,
            creating living, breathing compositions.
          </p>
        </a>

        <a href="lessons/07-interaction.html" class="lesson-card" id="lesson-interaction">
          <div class="lesson-number">Lesson 7</div>
          <h3>Interaction</h3>
          <p>
            Responsive systems. Your work can listen and respond to mouse movement, clicks, and
            keyboard input, creating dialogue between user and machine.
          </p>
        </a>

        <a href="lessons/08-typography.html" class="lesson-card" id="lesson-typography">
          <div class="lesson-number">Lesson 8</div>
          <h3>Typography</h3>
          <p>
            Text as visual element. Explore dynamic, responsive typography and treat letters
            as programmable graphic forms.
          </p>
        </a>

        <a href="lessons/09-variation.html" class="lesson-card" id="lesson-variation">
          <div class="lesson-number">Lesson 9</div>
          <h3>Variation</h3>
          <p>
            Controlled randomness and generative thinking. Create systems that produce infinite
            variations within defined constraints.
          </p>
        </a>

      <h2>About This Course</h2>
      <p>
        This curriculum follows the philosophy of computational art pioneers like John Maeda and
        Casey Reas, who view programming not as engineering but as a creative medium with its own
        unique properties and possibilities.
      </p>
      <p>
        P5.js is a JavaScript library that makes coding accessible and visual. Created by Lauren
        McCarthy, it builds on the work of Processing (created by Casey Reas and Ben Fry) and
        brings creative coding to the web browser.
      </p>

      <h2>How to Use This Course</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Work through lessons in order - each builds on previous concepts</li>
        <li>Experiment freely with the code examples - you cannot break anything</li>
        <li>Type slowly and observe what happens as you change values</li>
        <li>Use the Reset button to restore original code if needed</li>
        <li>There are no wrong answers - exploration is the goal</li>
      </ul>
