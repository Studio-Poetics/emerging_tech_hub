# Physical Computing Learning Tool - Design System

A comprehensive design system for an educational platform focused on physical computing and hardware-software integration.

## Philosophy

This design system prioritizes **clarity, progression, and focus** over visual complexity. The tool is designed as "an online scroll of text that unfolds in one direction" - emphasizing linear learning progression and minimal distraction.

### Core Principles

1. **Single Bold Color**: Uses one primary blue (#1E40AF) instead of gradients or multiple colors
2. **High Contrast**: Blue text on white backgrounds, white text on dark backgrounds
3. **Progressive Disclosure**: Content and activities unlock as users progress
4. **Adaptive Interface**: Elements change color and behavior based on context
5. **Learning-First**: Every design decision supports the educational experience
