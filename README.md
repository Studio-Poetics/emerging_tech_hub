#Architecture
##Core Structure
Main Hub: index-experimental.html serves as the central navigation hub
Technology Landing Pages: Individual domain pages (ai-landing.html, blockchain-landing.html, etc.)
Interactive Learning: Dedicated flashcard systems and activities for each domain
Design System: Comprehensive styling through experimental-design.css
Key Page Types
Hub Page (index-experimental.html): Central navigation with technology grid
Landing Pages (*-landing.html): Domain-specific learning hubs with 5 sections each:
Fundamentals (core concepts)
Readings (research papers and materials)
Flashcards (interactive learning)
Field Kit (tools and hardware)
Activities (hands-on projects)
Flashcard Systems
