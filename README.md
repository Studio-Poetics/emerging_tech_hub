# 🌐 Emerging Tech Hub

**Emerging Tech Hub** is an educational platform for learning about **emerging technologies** — including **AI, Blockchain, Robotics, Quantum Computing**, and more.  

The platform offers **interactive learning modules** with:
- Flashcards  
- Activities  
- Readings  
- Field Kits  

Each technology domain is designed to help learners explore both **conceptual understanding** and **hands-on experimentation**.

---

## 🧩 Architecture

### Core Structure

- **Main Hub:**  
  `index-experimental.html` serves as the **central navigation hub**.

- **Technology Landing Pages:**  
  Each domain has its own page (e.g., `ai-landing.html`, `blockchain-landing.html`, etc.).

- **Interactive Learning:**  
  Each domain includes dedicated **flashcard systems** and **activities** for active learning.

- **Design System:**  
  Unified visual identity is maintained through `experimental-design.css`.

### 🗂️ Key Page Types

#### 1. Hub Page — `index-experimental.html`
The **central navigation interface**, displaying a **technology grid** that links to each domain’s landing page.

#### 2. Landing Pages — `*-landing.html`
Each domain’s **learning hub** features five main sections:

1. **Fundamentals** — Core concepts and theoretical foundations  
2. **Readings** — Research papers, articles, and curated materials  
3. **Flashcards** — Interactive learning tools for self-assessment  
4. **Field Kit** — Tools, hardware, or software used in hands-on exploration  
5. **Activities** — Projects and experiments for experiential learning
