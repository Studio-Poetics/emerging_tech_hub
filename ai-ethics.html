                    <h2>Why AI Ethics Matters More Than Ever</h2>

                    <p>Imagine if a bank's AI system automatically denied loans to people from certain neighborhoods, or if a hiring algorithm systematically rejected qualified women. These aren't hypothetical scenarios‚Äîthey've actually happened. As AI becomes more powerful and widespread, the ethical implications of our technology choices affect millions of people's lives.</p>

                    <p>AI ethics isn't about slowing down innovation‚Äîit's about building better, more trustworthy systems that benefit everyone. Companies with strong ethical AI practices often see better business outcomes, reduced legal risks, and stronger customer trust.</p>

                        <p><strong>Like car safety features:</strong> Seat belts, airbags, and safety testing don't make cars slower‚Äîthey make them safer and more trustworthy. AI ethics is similar: building in fairness, transparency, and accountability from the start creates better products people can rely on.</p>

                        <p>AI systems reflect the values and biases of their creators and training data. Ethical AI isn't just about avoiding harm‚Äîit's about actively designing systems that promote fairness, transparency, and human wellbeing.</p>

                                <h4>The Problem</h4>
                                <p>AI systems can discriminate against certain groups, often in subtle ways that are hard to detect. This happens because AI learns from historical data that already contains human biases.</p>
                            </div>

                            <div class="real-example">
                                <h4>Real Example: Amazon's Hiring AI</h4>
                                <p>Amazon built an AI system to screen resumes but scrapped it when they discovered it was biased against women. The AI learned from 10 years of historical hiring data, which reflected past discrimination in tech hiring. It downgraded resumes that included words like "women's" (as in "women's chess club captain").</p>
