                <article class="essay-body">
                    <p>Interaction design in India has never been more visible. More schools offering programs. More companies hiring designers. More conferences, talks, exhibitions. The field is expanding rapidly.</p>

                    <p>And yet something's broken.</p>

                    <p>The growth is real, but it's hollow. What was supposed to be a critical practice—rethinking how humans and technologies relate—has mostly become a service layer for software companies. Education feeds the corporate pipeline. Experimentation happens in elite art spaces nobody visits. Critical writing barely exists. And somehow, people with shaky fundamentals end up defining the discourse.</p>

                    <p>This isn't nostalgia for some golden age that never existed. It's a structural diagnosis. The problems are systemic, not personal. And they're getting worse.</p>

                    <h2>How Education Became Job Training</h2>

                    <p>Here's what happened: as India's IT and platform economy grew, design schools realized they could market themselves as gateways to high-paying jobs. And they did. Aggressively.</p>

                    <p>Look at how institutions talk about themselves now. Placement rates. Corporate partnerships. Alumni working at Google, Meta, Amazon. Workshops named after software tools. Curricula that read like job descriptions. Faculty celebrating LinkedIn updates about student offers.</p>

                    <p>NID and IDC—schools that were supposed to be India's intellectual and cultural flagships—have increasingly reorganized around these metrics. I'm not saying they've abandoned research entirely. But the balance has shifted. When survival and reputation depend on placement stats, intellectual risk becomes expensive. Harder to justify. Easier to cut.</p>

                    <p>And students aren't stupid. They see the incentive structure. Many arrive already instrumentalized, treating education as workforce credentialing. Which is rational! India's economy is brutal, and design jobs pay well compared to most fields. But when both supply (students) and demand (institutions) align around employability, depth gets squeezed out.</p>

                    <p>Martha Nussbaum calls this the "education for profit" model. She's right. But in India it's intensified by scale and precarity. The result? Students learn to execute briefs, not interrogate them. They reproduce design patterns fluently without understanding where those patterns came from or what assumptions they carry.</p>

                    <h2>The Admission Problem</h2>

                    <p>This gets worse at the entry point.</p>

                    <p>As demand for design education surged, selection processes struggled to scale. Entrance exams and portfolio reviews increasingly favor superficial signals: polished presentation, familiarity with the aesthetic du jour, coached performance. They correlate weakly with actual capacity for inquiry, observation, or critical thinking.</p>

                    <p>I'm not blaming students. The system selects for the wrong things, then compounds the problem by lowering expectations to accommodate larger cohorts. Teaching adapts downward rather than challenging people upward. Standards erode gradually, almost invisibly. But they erode.</p>

                    <p>Donald Schön warned about this decades ago: when professional education prioritizes technique over reflection, you get competent operators, not reflective practitioners. That's exactly what's happening. Interaction design is becoming procedural knowledge—a set of moves to execute—rather than a mode of inquiry.</p>

                    <h2>Screen Obsession</h2>

                    <p>Ask most people in India what interaction design means, and they'll describe UI/UX for apps and websites. That's it. Screens.</p>

                    <p>This is bizarre for multiple reasons. First, interaction design historically emerged from human-computer interaction, ergonomics, embodied cognition, tangible computing—fields that explicitly rejected screen-centrism. Paul Dourish's entire argument in <em>Where the Action Is</em> is that interaction isn't about interfaces; it's about embodied action in the world.</p>

                    <p>Second, India has extraordinarily rich traditions of material culture, ritual interaction, spatial negotiation, tacit knowledge. Walk through any informal market or public transport system and you see complex interaction choreographies that have nothing to do with screens. These could be incredible resources for design thinking.</p>

                    <p>But design education here remains oddly disembodied. Physical computing, speculative objects, performative systems, alternative interfaces—if they appear at all, they're electives. Novelties. Not methodologies.</p>

                    <p>Why? Because the industry doesn't hire for that. Job descriptions ask for Figma skills, not critical making. So schools teach Figma. And the loop closes tighter.</p>

                    <h2>Experimental Work's Elite Bubble</h2>

                    <p>Meanwhile, there's this parallel track of "experimental" work happening in galleries, biennales, residencies. Technology-driven art. New media. Interactive installations.</p>

                    <p>Some of it's genuinely good. But a lot of it—and I've seen this repeatedly—is aestheticized ambiguity. Vague artist statements full of buzzwords: AI, data, futures, posthumanism, entanglement. Ask what those words mean in the actual work and you get evasion or silence.</p>

                    <p>Here's the problem: these projects circulate in closed cultural loops. They're shown to other artists, curators, the occasional academic. Public engagement is minimal. And because peer review is weak and funding criteria are opaque, work can be rewarded for sounding complex rather than being grounded.</p>

                    <p>Claire Bishop critiqued this tendency in participatory art years ago—the gap between rhetoric and reality, between claiming social engagement and actually producing it. In India, the problem is amplified because there are so few platforms for serious criticism. Disagreement is culturally uncomfortable. So weak work can accumulate legitimacy through repetition and visibility alone.</p>

                    <p>And this matters because when experimentation becomes inaccessible even in intention, it reinforces the perception that contemporary design and art are for insiders only. Elitist. Disconnected. Which then justifies ignoring them, which weakens the ecosystem further.</p>

                    <h2>Where's the Writing?</h2>

                    <p>One of the starkest gaps: there's almost no sustained critical writing about interaction design in India.</p>

                    <p>Design gets made. Exhibited. Posted on Instagram. But where's the argumentation? The disagreement? The attempts to situate work within broader intellectual traditions or challenge prevailing assumptions?</p>

                    <p>Theory circulates, sure. But it's often decorative. Designers drop references—"speculative design," "critical AI," "design justice"—without unpacking them. It's conceptual garnish. Big words attached to shallow practice.</p>

                    <p>Bruno Latour argued that critique needs to move from debunking to assembling, from tearing things down to composing better alternatives. Fine. But India hasn't even institutionalized critique strongly enough to do the debunking part. Without rigorous writing and debate, the field risks becoming repetitive and intellectually hollow.</p>

                    <h2>Can This Get Better?</h2>

                    <p>Look, it's not all bleak. Across India, small studios and independent educators are doing interesting work. Exploring alternative pedagogies, indigenous knowledge systems, ethical technology practices, speculative tools. Blurring boundaries between art, engineering, philosophy, craft.</p>

                    <p>These efforts exist. They're just marginal.</p>

                    <p>For the field to actually mature—not just expand—several things would need to change:</p>

                    <p>Education would need to be understood as intellectual formation, not just skill delivery. NID and IDC would need to reassert themselves as places that lead cultural and intellectual conversation, not just feed the hiring pipeline. Admission processes would need to value curiosity and rigor over polish. Experimental work would need to be evaluated by clarity of intent and method, not novelty or jargon.</p>

                    <p>And most fundamentally: interaction design would need to be understood not as interface production but as inquiry into relationships between humans, technologies, and worlds. This means embracing friction, ambiguity, politics, ethics, cultural specificity. Not smoothing everything into frictionless flows.</p>

                    <p>Can that happen? Maybe. But right now the incentives point the other way. And without serious structural change, the field will keep growing in size while shrinking in significance.</p>

                    <h2>Why These Criticisms Aren't Just Opinion</h2>

                    <p>I realize the above reads as harsh. Some people will dismiss it as subjective griping or nostalgia for imaginary past standards.</p>

                    <p>So let me be clear: these aren't just personal observations. They're grounded in well-documented patterns in higher education globally, and they're intensified in India for specific structural reasons.</p>

                    <h3>On the "industry-first" turn</h3>

                    <p>Universities worldwide have undergone what sociologists call <strong>marketization</strong>. They increasingly operate like businesses, optimizing for metrics: placement rates, employability stats, rankings, corporate partnerships. This isn't India-specific, but it hits harder here because of economic precarity and demographic pressure—millions of young people competing for stable jobs.</p>

                    <p>Slaughter and Rhoades call this "academic capitalism"—when institutions reorient knowledge production toward market value rather than epistemic value. You can see it in curriculum language (skills, tools, industry readiness), evaluation criteria (placement success), marketing (alumni at tech firms), workshop topics (aligned with software ecosystems).</p>

                    <p>These aren't random choices. They're structural responses to funding models and accountability pressures. The critique isn't that schools collaborate with industry—that can be valuable—but that industry logic increasingly defines educational purpose. When that happens, other roles of education (critical inquiry, speculative exploration, cultural interpretation) become optional add-ons.</p>

                    <h3>On admission and standards</h3>

                    <p>When applicant pools grow rapidly and institutions expand capacity, selection processes default to standardized, scalable methods. These tend to favor surface-level creativity, portfolio polish, and coached performance over depth of thinking or research potential.</p>

                    <p>This isn't about blaming students. It's about recognizing that creative aptitude and critical reasoning are hard to measure in short tests or interviews—research on higher education assessment consistently shows this.</p>

                    <p>Meanwhile, many applicants now approach design education instrumentally because job outcomes matter in an uncertain economy. That's rational. But when both students and institutions optimize for employability, the system structurally discourages depth. Call it mediocrity creep if you want, or just recognize it as what happens when expectations lower to accommodate scale.</p>

                    <h3>On the screen fixation</h3>

                    <p>Interaction design emerged from HCI, ergonomics, embodied cognition, tangible computing. Foundational thinkers like Lucy Suchman and Paul Dourish explicitly argued that interaction is situated, embodied, social—not just interface-based.</p>

                    <p>But if you look at institutional curricula, job descriptions, portfolio expectations, and recruitment tests, they overwhelmingly equate interaction design with mobile apps, web dashboards, design systems, usability flows. Physical computing, tangible interfaces, spatial interaction, performative systems—these appear marginally, if at all.</p>

                    <p>This is especially strange in India, where everyday life is deeply interactive beyond screens. Informal infrastructures, gesture-based negotiation, spatial improvisation, embodied knowledge systems. Ignoring these isn't neutral; it reflects epistemic bias toward Western platform-centered models.</p>

                    <p>The critique here is epistemological: a limited definition of interaction limits what can be known, explored, or designed.</p>

                    <h3>On experimental art-tech work</h3>

                    <p>Claire Bishop and others have shown how participatory and new-media art can be rhetorically progressive while socially hollow. The issue isn't experimentation itself—it's lack of accountability.</p>

                    <p>In many funding ecosystems, selection criteria emphasize novelty, alignment with trendy keywords (AI, data, posthuman), conceptual framing over methodological rigor, artist statements over demonstrable inquiry. When peer review is weak, vague conceptualism circulates unchallenged.</p>

                    <p>And because this work often appears in elite galleries or festivals, it speaks mainly to insiders. Public legibility becomes optional. Over time: alienation rather than engagement.</p>

                    <p>Rigorous experimentation requires clear research questions, articulated methods, accountable claims, conceptual literacy. Without these, it becomes aestheticized ambiguity.</p>

                    <h3>On fragile leadership</h3>

                    <p>In emerging or weakly theorized fields, symbolic capital can substitute for intellectual depth. When a discipline lacks strong traditions of critique, peer review, or writing, visibility can outweigh substance.</p>

                    <p>Bourdieu described how cultural fields operate through symbolic power: those who control language, platforms, or institutional access often define legitimacy. When evaluation criteria are unclear, confidence and vocabulary can outperform rigor.</p>

                    <p>This gets amplified when there are few critical journals, when discourse happens mainly through talks and exhibitions, when mentorship is thin, when disagreement is culturally discouraged. The result: a fragile ecosystem where weak foundations can generate authority.</p>

                    <h3>What I'm not saying</h3>

                    <p>To be clear: I'm not arguing that industry collaboration is harmful, employment is unimportant, experimentation is useless, or institutions have failed entirely.</p>

                    <p>I'm arguing that imbalance has consequences. Healthy fields sustain tension between utility and inquiry, skill and thought, making and questioning, practice and theory. When one side dominates completely, resilience collapses.</p>

                    <h3>What would help</h3>

                    <p>A stronger future would involve: reframing education as epistemic training, not just skill delivery. Strengthening writing and critique as core competencies. Treating interaction as embodied, cultural, political. Evaluating experimental work through clarity and method. Encouraging disagreement. Letting institutions be intellectual leaders, not just placement agencies.</p>

                    <p>These aren't utopian fantasies. They're how mature disciplines sustain themselves.</p>

                    <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

                    <p>This critique isn't an attack on individuals or institutions. It's a diagnosis of drift.</p>

                    <p>The discomfort it might provoke isn't a flaw—it's evidence that it touches real tensions. If interaction design in India is going to mature rather than just expand, it needs to reclaim its capacity for reflection, disagreement, and depth.</p>

                    <p>Without that, growth becomes hollow. Productivity replaces purpose. And design loses its ability to think.</p>
