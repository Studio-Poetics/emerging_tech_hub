# Bio-Robotics Content Strategy
## Non-Technical User Focus: Art, Wonder, and Human Experience

**Target Audience:** Designers, artists, product managers, futurists, ethicists, and curious minds interested in the intersection of biology, technology, and art.

**Core Philosophy:** Approach bio-robotics not as an engineering discipline, but as a creative, speculative, and deeply human exploration of what it means to be alive, embodied, and sensing in a world where biology and technology merge.

   - **Why It Matters:**
     - Art meets regenerative medicine
     - Explores future where we "print" body parts
     - Raises questions about death, relics, and biology as material
